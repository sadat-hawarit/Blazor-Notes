### Can we check the Input File if named differently
Check MIME type in `<InputFile>`: CurrentFile.ContentType
For Revit, MIME type is `application/octet-stream`

# Blazor Performance Best Practices

---
# Optimize Rendering Speed

---
## Avoid unnecessary rendering of component subtrees
- Ensure that child component parameters are of primitive immutable types
- **Override `ShouldRender`:** to accept nonprimitive parameters & if UI-only component that doesn't change after the initial render
---
## Virtualization
Virtualization is a technique for limiting UI rendering to just the parts that are currently visible.

---
## Create lightweight, optimized components
ðŸ’¡ Common scenarios where components for poor UI performance:
- Large nested forms with hundreds of individual elements, such as inputs or labels.
- Grids with hundreds of rows or thousands of cells.
- Scatter plots with millions of data points.

---
### Avoid thousands of component instances
- Inline child components into their parents
- Define reusableÂ RenderFragmentsÂ in code
---
### Dont receive too many parameters
To reduce parameter load, bundle multiple parameters in a custom class.

---
### Ensure cascading parameters are fixed
IfÂ IsFixedÂ isÂ trueÂ (for example,Â `<CascadingValue Value="@someValue" IsFixed="true">)`, recipients receive the initial value but don't set up a subscription to receive updates. EachÂ `[CascadingParameter]`Â is lightweight and no more expensive than a regularÂ `[Parameter]`.

---

### Avoid attribute splatting with `CaptureUnmatchedValues`
Dont use this too much:
`[Parameter(CaptureUnmatchedValues = true)]`
this approach is expensive because the renderer must:
- Match all of the supplied parameters against the set of known parameters to build a dictionary.
- Keep track of how multiple copies of the same attribute overwrite each other.
---
### ImplementÂ SetParametersAsyncÂ manually
In some extreme cases, you may wish to avoid the reflection and implement your own parameter-setting logic manually. If the overhead of receiving parameters has an observable impact on UI responsiveness.

---
## Dont trigger events too rapidly
For example, `OnMouseMove`/`OnScroll` event needs to be triggered. We can add Interval or an Area where this event will occur, so that this does not trigger too rapidly or frequently

---
## Avoid rerendering after handling events without state changes
```cs
<button @onclick="HandleClick1"> 
Select me (Rerenders) 
</button> 
<button @onclick="EventUtil.AsNonRenderingEventHandler(HandleClick2)"> 
Select me (Avoids Rerender) 
</button> 
<button @onclick="EventUtil.AsNonRenderingEventHandler<MouseEventArgs>(HandleClick3)"> 
Select me (Avoids Rerender and uses <code>MouseEventArgs</code>) 
</button>
```
Not every event changes states, No need to rerender

---

--- 
## Avoid recreating delegates for many repeated elements or components
Instead of lmbda expression delegates
```cs
<button @onclick="@(e => UpdateHeading(e, buttonNumber))">
```
Assign action:
```cs
<button @key="button.Id" @onclick="button.Action">
@code{
button.Action = (e) => { UpdateHeading(button, e); };
}
```

---
# Optimize JavaScript InterOp speed

---

## Avoid excessively fine-grained calls
Instead of:
```cs
foreach (var item in items) { await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("localStorage.setItem", item.Id, JsonSerializer.Serialize(item)); }
```
Use:
```cs
await JS.InvokeVoidAsync("storeAllInLocalStorage", items);
```
Where JS:
```js
function storeAllInLocalStorage(items) { items.forEach(item => { localStorage.setItem(item.id, JSON.stringify(item)); }); }
```


---
## Consider use of Synchronus calls
Results in fewer render cycles
- **JS from .NET:** `Invoke` instead of `InvokeAsync`
- **.NET from JS:** `Dotnet.InvokeMethod` instead of `Dotnet.InvokeMethodAsync`
---
# AOT compilation
AOT-compiled apps result in larger apps that take longer to download, but AOT-compiled apps usually provide better runtime performance, especially for apps that execute CPU-intensive tasks.

---
# Minimize app download size

---
## Runtime Relinking
Relinking the .NET WebAssembly runtime trims unused runtime code and thus improves download speed. With the .NET WebAssembly build tools installed, runtime relinking is performed automatically when an app isÂ **published**Â in theÂ `Release`Â configuration.

---
## Use System.Text.Json
Blazor's JS interop implementation relies onÂ [System.Text.Json](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.json), which is a high-performance JSON serialization library with low memory allocation. (Instead of Newtonsoft.Json)

---
## Intermediate Language trimming
Trimming unused assemblies from a Blazor WebAssembly app reduces the app's size by removing unused code in the app's binaries.

---
## Lazy load assemblies
Load assemblies at runtime when the assemblies are required by a route.

---
## Compression
When a Blazor WebAssembly app is published, the output is statically compressed during publish to reduce the app's size and remove the overhead for runtime compression

---
## Disable Unused Features
Blazor WebAssembly's runtime includes the following .NET features that can be disabled for a smaller payload size. For example: TimeZone and Globalization

---
# JS Interop

---
## Call JS from .NET
```cs
private async Task ConvertArray() 
{ 
	text = new(await JS.InvokeAsync<string>("convertArray", quoteArray))
}; 
```


---
## Catch JS Exception
```cs
try { }

catch (JSException e) {}
```

Â A URL is a type of URI, but not all URIs are URLs.Â 
Â For example,Â `https://www.bing.com`Â is both a URI and a URL, butÂ `bing.com`Â is only a URI
